# Frontline -- A Card Game with 4x4 grid
**This repository is for noting my progress on my G10 personal project.**
This project is still under development. The repository is created in order to track the updates. It serves as the proof of my work. 

The game cannot be installed or played yet. I'm still discovering how to use github and other stuff. 

The images are generated using [Stable Diffusion](https://civitai.com/models/27259/tmnd-mix) and DALL-E. 

## Developed using:
- boardgame.io
- Create React App

The project starts on 9/8 2023 and the repository is created on 1/1 2024.

Update 1/5: I recreated this after learning git commands. 
Update 1/25: The project is now deployed with [cloudflare](https://frontline-the-card-game.pages.dev)
1/26: the cloudflare deployment only deploys the client side. I'm still working on deploying the server but the demo is locally playable(deprecated)
1/29: The game is playable with [render](https://frontline-server.onrender.com) with server deployed on the same location.(active)
